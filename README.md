# Recursive-Multi-Scale-Image-Deraining-With-Sub-Pixel-Convolution-Based-Feature-Fusion-and-Context Aggregation
In this paper, we propose a new single image deraining architecture with competitive deraining performance. Specifically we use a recursive technique of deraining with two modules cascaded each other. The first module -called front-end module- is dedicated to remove the rain at coarse level and is based on dense fusion of lower label features followed by sub-pixel convolutions. The second module -called refinement module- is dedicated to further remove the remnant of rain streaks and is based on context aggregation networks. The overall architecture is trained end to end and is capable to produce high-quality results -on both real-world and synthetic datasets- that are superior to several famous techniques in the literature.
